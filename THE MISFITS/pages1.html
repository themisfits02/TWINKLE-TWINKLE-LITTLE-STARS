  <br>A star is a sphere of gas held together by its own gravity.
    The closest star to Earth is our very own Sun, so we have an example nearby that astronomers can study in detail.</br>
    They might look like tiny dots of light, but each star is a massive ball of burning gas like our own sun.</br> 
    <br>The Milky Way galaxy alone is home to somewhere around 100 billion of them. 
    The lessons we learn about the Sun can be applied to other stars.</br>
