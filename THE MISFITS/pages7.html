        What is a variable star? Astronomers know millions of them, and you might find a one in any part of the sky. Among the stars in this image of the central region of the Milky Way galaxy, there are 2 known Cepheid variables. 
        They vary due to internal changes in the star.

            <h1 class="title">The Dramatic dimming of Betelgeuse</h1>
         </div>
         <div class="left">
            A famous recent example is the red supergiant star Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion the Hunter. Betelgeuse is one of our sky’s brightest stars. It’s a prominent star, in a noticeable constellation. And thus there was a worldwide outcry, when, in late 2019, Betelgeuse suddenly began to dim. By February 2020, Betelgeuse was only half as bright as before.
Betelgeuse is nearing the end of its life. Many are aware that – within the next 100,000 years (soon, from an astronomical perspective) – Betelgeuse might explode as a supernova. Could the dimming be a sign Betelgeuse was about to explode?
Betelgeuse did not explode, and its brightness has now returned to normal. Why did it suddenly dim? Astronomers note that, as the internal process of stars like Betelgeuse began to change, the star throws off enormous clouds of dark dust. Astronomers believe that dust clouds dimmed Betelgeuse’s light as seen from the Earth.
Will Betelgeuse fade noticeably again? It might, but it’s not possible to predict exactly when.
Do all variable stars brighten and dim due to obscuring clouds of gas? No. There’s more than one reason for a star to change its brightness. That’s why it’s helpful to divide variable stars into categories.

         </div>
         <div class="left">
            Intrinsic variable stars change in brightness due to events happening within the star itself.
Cepheid variables are the most important of this type. These stars are called pulsating variable stars. They literally pulse: get bigger and then smaller in size. As they expand and contract, their brightness changes.
Cepheid variables are named for the first known example of the type, the star Delta Cephei, discovered to be variable in 1874.
It wasn’t until 1908 that astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt discovered a direct relationship between the rate at which a Cepheid fluctuates in brightness and its luminosity or absolute brightness. A street light will appear dimmer as you move farther from it. Likewise, more distant stars appear dimmer than closer stars, assuming both have the same absolute brightness. And that’s why Cepheids are useful. If you see a Cepheid brightening and dimming at a certain rate, you know its true brightness. So you can see how bright it looks and thereby know its distance.
Cepheid variables are powerful tools in astronomy. They were an early stepping stone in the establishment of the cosmic distance ladder that now enables astronomers to estimate distances to objects hundreds, thousands, millions and billions of light-years away.

          <div class="left">
            Cepheid variables’ luminosity is directly related to their periodicity. This makes it easy to measure their distance. 
            The two types of Cepheids shown here have a slightly different relationship between their luminosity and period, due to difference in age; Type II Cepheids are older stars than Type I.

            Cataclysmic variables increase in brightness at irregular intervals. Several types of cataclysmic variables exist. Here a white dwarf star orbits a 2nd, larger star, from which matter flows to the white dwarf. When enough matter has accumulated on the white dwarf’s surface, a fusion outburst causes the star to brighten radically. 
            Once the incoming hydrogen has become fused into helium, the star dims again until the next cycle.

            <h1 class="title">Extrinsic variables</h1>
         </div>
         <div class="left">
            Extrinsic variable stars have brightness fluctuations due to external factors. Again, there are many different types, but they break down into two main groups: eclipsing binaries and rotating variables.
Eclipsing binaries are systems containing two orbiting stars. As seen from the Earth, one star passes in front of the other, causing the eclipsed star’s brightness to fluctuate regularly. A famous example of this type of variable is Algol. Another group of eclipsing variable stars is the W Ursae Majoris variables, where binary stars are situated so close to each other that they whip around each other in less than a day, and the surfaces of the two stars are so close that they are nearly touching.
Rotating variables, on the other hand, are variable stars where the brightness fluctuates due to phenomena associated with their rotation. There are many kinds of rotating variables, for example stars with huge sunspots on their surface which, as these rotate into view of the Earth, block and dim the light from the star.

        An eclipsing variable brightens and dims regularly as the two stars alternately eclipse each other as seen from Earth. This is how Algol, the “ghoul star”, varies in brightness. 
        Its mention in the 3,200 year old Cairo calendar is likely the first documented case of a variable star.
