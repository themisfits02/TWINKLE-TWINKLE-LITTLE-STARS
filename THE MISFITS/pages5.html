        The study of variable stars can reveal much about the nature, history and future of stars. There are many astronomers – both amateur and professional – who study them. And organizations such as the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) serve as collectors and collators of variable star observations.
Variable stars show that you don’t always need sophisticated and expensive technology to do useful and valuable science. On a base level, all you need is your eyes, although these can of course be augmented with telescopes and equipment to measure the brightness of a star. But all you really need is the ability to estimate the brightness of a star by comparing it to that of others. This skill can be acquired with practice, if you wish to become a variable-star observer.

            Its increases in brightness occur every 4 to 10 weeks and range from about magnitude 12 to magnitude 8 (where 8 is the brightest).
