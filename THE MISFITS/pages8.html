        Understanding the uncertainties involved in the techniques used to detect exoplanets is an important aspect of the search for life beyond the Earth, especially in light of recent controversy over the statistical significance of planet detections. Consider for example Kepler, NASA’s 1.4 m space telescope that will spend at least 3.5 years staring at 100,000 stars. It’s looking for transiting exoplanets, which block part of the light from their host star if they happen to pass in front of our line of sight. We can detect these transits and infer the properties of the planet by watching for tiny dips in the light curve (brightness over time) of the star. 
        But what if the star dims for some other reason – would this interfere with our ability to detect a planet?

        The Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, abbreviated as H–R diagram, HR diagram or HRD, is a scatter plot of stars showing the relationship between the stars' 
        absolute magnitudes or luminosities versus their stellar classifications or effective temperatures. The diagram was created independently in 1911 by Ejnar Hertzsprung and by Henry Norris Russell in 1913, 
        and represented a major step towards an understanding of stellar evolution
