    <h1 class="title">Life Cycle of a Star</h1>
 </div>
 <div class="left">
    <br>The starting phase for all stars, including our Sun, begins when a dense region in a nebula begins to shrink and warm up. This is usually the result of one of several events that may occur to initiate the gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud.</br>
    <br>The means by which this occurs include galactic collisions or a devastating nearby supernova explosion sending ruptured matter into the clouds at very high speeds.</br> 
    <br>Each of these stellar maternity wards can form anything from a few dozen to thousands of stars.</br>

    <h1 class="title">High-mass Stars</h1>
 </div>
 <div class="left">
    <br>High mass stars (stars with masses greater than three times the mass of the Sun) are the largest, hottest and brightest Main Sequence stars and blue, blue-white or white in colour. High mass stars use up their hydrogen fuel very rapidly and consequently have short lives.</br>
    <br>High mass stars pass through a Red Supergiant stage before dying catastrophically in supernovae explosions. Remnant stellar cores which survive supernovae can be sufficiently dense to form neutron stars (a star composed almost entirely of neutrons about 10 to 20 kilometres in diameter), pulsars (rapidly rotating neutron stars) or black holes (objects smaller than neutron stars with a gravitational attraction so strong that not even light can escape).</br>
    <br>Supernovae events are important, if rare, within galaxies. All elements heavier than hydrogen and helium are produced within stars at different stages in their life cycles. Supernovae release these elements into space making them available to be incorporated within later generations of stars.</br>

 </div>
 <div class="left">
   <br> Low mass stars (stars with masses less than half the mass of the Sun) are the smallest, coolest and dimmest Main Sequence stars and orange, red or brown in colour.</br>
   <br> Low mass stars use up their hydrogen fuel very slowly and consequently have long lives. Low mass stars simply die by burning up their fuel to leave behind white dwarfs (contracted low mass stars about the size of the Earth) which themselves cool and contract further to black dwarfs.</br>

    <h1 class="title">Red Giant</h1>
 </div>
 <div class="left">
    <br>Red giants star are of the spectral types M and K and are much smaller than red supergiants and much less massive. When a star has consumed its stock of hydrogen in its core, fusion stops and the star no longer generates an outward pressure to counteract the inward pressure pulling it together.</br>
<br>Therefore, a shell of hydrogen around the core ignites, continuing the life of the star but causes it to increase in size dramatically. This is what creates a red giant.</br>

  <br>Red giants can be 100 times larger than the star was in its main sequence phase. When this hydrogen fuel is used up, further shells of helium and even heavier elements can be consumed in fusion reactions.</br>
<br>They normally have temperatures of around 3,300 to 5,300 K, and luminosities around 100 to 1,000 times that of the Sun. They also have a mass of between 0.3 to 10 of the Sunâ€™s. Red giants live for around 0.1 to 2 billion years, before they run out of fuel completely and become a white dwarf. Examples of a red giant are Aldebaran and Arcturus.</br>

    <h1 class="title">Red Supergiant</h1>
 </div>
 <div class="left">
<br>Red supergiants stars  are stars that have exhausted their supply of hydrogen at their cores, and therefore their outer layers expand hugely as they evolve off the main sequence. </br>
<br>They are of the spectral types K and M and are among the biggest stars in the universe, though they are not among the most massive or luminous.</br>
<br>They have temperatures of between 3,500 to 4,500 K, and luminosities between 1,000 to 800,000 times that of the Sun. Red Supergiants have a mass of between 10 to 40 times that of the Sun and live for around 3 to 100 million years.</br>
<br>Some red supergiants which still can create heavy elements eventually explode as type-II supernovas. Examples of a red supergiant are Antares and Betelgeuse.</br>
