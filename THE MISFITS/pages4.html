     <div class="left">
    <br>A planetary nebula (PN, plural PNe) is a type of emission nebula consisting of an expanding, glowing shell of ionized gas ejected from red giant stars late in their lives.</br>
  <br>The term originates from the planet-like round shape of these nebulae observed by astronomers through early telescopes.</br>
<br>It is expected that the Sun will form a planetary nebula at the end of its life cycle.They are relatively short-lived phenomena, lasting perhaps a few tens of millennia, compared to considerably longer phases of stellar evolution.</br>
<br>Once all of the red giant's atmosphere has been dissipated, energetic ultraviolet radiation from the exposed hot luminous core, called a planetary nebula nucleus (P.N.N.), ionizes the ejected material.</br>
<br>Planetary nebulae probably play a crucial role in the chemical evolution of the Milky Way.</br>
<br>Starting from the 1990s, Hubble Space Telescope images revealed that many planetary nebulae have extremely complex and varied morphologies.</br>

            <h1 class="title">White Dwarf</h1>
         </div>
         <div class="left">
        <br>A white dwarf star is formed when a star has completely run out of hydrogen fuel in its core and it lacks the mass to force higher elements into fusion reaction. </br>
      <br>The outward light pressure from the fusion reaction stops and the star collapses inward under its own gravity.</br>
    <br>The reason a white dwarf shines is because it was a hot star once, but there’s no fusion reactions happening anymore. They normally have temperatures of between 8,000 to 40,000 K, and luminosities around 0.0001 to 100 times that of the Sun.</br>
  <br>They have a mass of about 0.1 to 1.4 times that of our Sun.
A white dwarf can live for between 100,000 to 10 billion years. Examples of a white dwarf are Sirius B and Procyon B.</br>

         </div>
         <div class="left">
        <br>Black dwarfs are theorised to be white dwarfs that have radiated away all their leftover heat and light.</br>
      <br> However, because white dwarfs have relatively high life spans, no black dwarfs have had enough time to form yet. This means black dwarfs are somewhat hypothetical. If a black dwarf were to form, it will be after our Sun has died.</br>

            <h1 class="title">Supernova</h1>
         </div>
         <div class="left">
        <br>A supernova is a powerful and luminous explosion of a star.</br>
      <br>Supernovae can expel several solar masses of material at velocities up to several percent of the speed of light. </br>
    <br>This drives an expanding shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium, sweeping up an expanding shell of gas and dust observed as a supernova remnant.</br>
  <br>Supernovae are a major source of elements in the interstellar medium from oxygen to rubidium. The expanding shock waves of supernovae can trigger the formation of new stars. Supernova remnants might be a major source of cosmic rays.</br>
<br>Supernovae might produce gravitational waves, though thus far, gravitational waves have been detected only from the mergers of black holes and neutron stars.</br>

         </div>
         <div class="left">
        <br>Neutron stars are the collapsed cores of massive stars that were compressed beyond the white dwarf stage during a supernova explosion.</br>
      <br>A neutron star is an unusual type of star that is composed entirely of neutrons — particles that are marginally more massive than protons, but carry no electrical charge.</br>
    <br>Neutron stars can collapse into black holes if they have more than 3 solar masses. They usually have temperatures of around 600,000 K and very low luminosities. </br>
  <br>They have a mass of about 1.4 to 3.2 times that of our Sun and live for between 100,000 to 10 billion years.</br>
<br>Examples of a neutron star are PSR J0108-1431 and PSR B1509-58.</br>

            <h1 class="title">Black Hole</h1>
         </div>
         <div class="left">
        <br>While small stars eventually become white dwarfs or neutron stars, stars with a high mass become black holes after a supernova explosion.</br>
      <br> Because the remnant has no outward pressure to oppose the force of gravity, it will continue to collapse into a gravitational singularity and eventually become a black hole. A black hole is so strong that not even light can escape it.</br>
    <br>Examples of a black hole are Cygnus X-1 and Sagittarius A.</br>
