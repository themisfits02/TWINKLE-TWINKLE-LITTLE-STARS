    <h1 class="title">Birth of a Star</h1>
 </div>
 <div class="left">
    <br>Stars are the most widely recognized astronomical objects, and represent the most fundamental building blocks of galaxies. The age, distribution, and composition of the stars in a galaxy trace the history, dynamics, and evolution of that galaxy.</br> 
    <br>Moreover, stars are responsible for the manufacture and distribution of heavy elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and their characteristics are intimately tied to the characteristics of the planetary systems that may coalesce about them. </br>
    <br>Consequently, the study of the birth, life, and death of stars is central to the field of astronomy.</br>

        <br>Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most galaxies. A familiar example of such as a dust cloud is the Orion Nebula. <br>Turbulence deep within these clouds gives rise to knots with sufficient mass that the gas and dust can begin to collapse under its own gravitational attraction.</br>
        <br>As the cloud collapses, the material at the center begins to heat up. Known as a protostar, it is this hot core at the heart of the collapsing cloud that will one day become a star. </br>
        Three-dimensional computer models of star formation predict that the spinning clouds of collapsing gas and dust may break up into two or three blobs; this would explain why the majority the stars in the Milky Way are paired or in groups of multiple stars.</br>
<br>As the cloud collapses, a dense, hot core forms and begins gathering dust and gas. Not all of this material ends up as part of a star — the remaining dust can become planets, asteroids, or comets or may remain as dust.</br>
<br>In some cases, the cloud may not collapse at a steady pace. In January 2004, an amateur astronomer, James McNeil, discovered a small nebula that appeared unexpectedly near the nebula Messier 78, in the constellation of Orion. When observers around the world pointed their instruments at Mcneil’s nebula , they found something interesting — its brightness appears to vary. 
Observations with NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory provided a likely explanation: the interaction between the young star's magnetic field and the surrounding gas causes episodic increases in brightness.</br>

    <h1 class="title">Nebula</h1>
 </div>
 <div class="left">
    <br>A nebula is an enormous cloud of dust and gas occupying the space between stars and acting as a nursery for new stars. The roots of the word come from Latin nebula, which means a “mist, vapor, fog, smoke, exhalation.” </br>
    <br>Nebulae are made up of dust, basic elements such as hydrogen and other ionized gases. They either form through clouds of cold interstellar gas and dust or through the aftermath of a supernova.</br>
<br>Some nebulae are bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. The Orion Nebula is one of these, located between the stars in the constellation Orion’s sword.</br>
<br>A nebula's color depends on what chemicals are in it, and how ionized it is. Because most of the universe is made of hydrogen, many emission nebulae appear red. Hydrogen glows red when it is hot. If the nebula is very hot, other types of gas will be heated and the it might also glow blue and green.</br>

<br>By looking at which colors are glowing in a nebula, one can figure out what it is made of.
Emission nebulae sometimes look like they have dark areas in them.This is because clouds of dust block the light when it is traveling between the nebula and the Earth.</br>

        <h1 class="title">Protostars</h1>
     </div>
    <div class="left">
    A protostar is a collection of gas that has collapsed down from a giant molecular cloud. It is what exists before a star forms. This stage usually lasts around 100,000 years and, over time, gravity and pressure increases, forcing the protostar to collapse.

    <h1 class="title">T-Tauri Phase</h1>
 </div>
<div class="left">
    A T Tauri star is the stage a star is at before it becomes a main sequence star. This occurs at the end of the protostar phase when the gravitational pressure holding the star together is the source of all its energy.
T Tauri stars don’t have enough pressure and temperature at their cores to generate nuclear fusion. However, they do resemble main-sequence stars — they’re about the same temperature but brighter because they’re larger. The T Tauri stage will last about 100 million years.
