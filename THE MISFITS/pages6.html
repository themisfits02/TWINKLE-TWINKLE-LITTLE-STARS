    <br> When you go out under a starry sky, the stars seem unchanging, eternal, constant. Occasionally you might see a nova or a supernova – apparently “new” stars – but such events usually last only weeks before fading from view, and they are rare (especially supernovae).</br>
  <br>Apart from those transient reminders that the universe is restless and constantly changing, the stars in the night sky seem to shine with a steady, unwavering light. But many stars are not constant.</br>
<br>Their brightness varies over time. We classify a star as a variable star if its light, as seen from the Earth, changes in brightness.</br>
<br>A variable star is one that’s known to dim and then brighten again.</br>
<br>Variable stars aren’t rare or unusual. By the year 2020, astronomers had identified more than 2 million variable stars, mostly in our galaxy. It’s not uncommon for amateur astronomers to make interesting and useful scientific discoveries about variable stars. You might wish to join them!</br>
<br>Most stars have at least some variation in luminosity: our own sun, for example, varies in brightness by a small amount (about 1%) over the course of its 11-year cycle. But unless the fluctuation is large enough to be seen from Earth, the star isn’t classified as variable.</br>
<br>The changes in brightness of variable stars aren’t generally noticeable to the unaided eye, even if the brightness does change over short timescales (say, hours).</br>
<br>To observe most variable stars, you need to monitor star brightnesses carefully over extended periods of time. But there are examples of stars whose brightness has noticeably faded, over short timescales.</br>

      <br>Any star that has evolved past the protostar stage (i.e. is producing energy due to internal nuclear reactions) but
has yet to arrive on the main sequence is called a Young Stellar Object (YSO).</br>
<br>YSO's come in a variety of forms depending on their age, mass, and environment, and include Herbig-Haro (HH) objects, T Tauri stars, and, in
general, immature stars prone to irregular brightening, embedded in nebulosity, and associated with bipolar
outflows.</br>
<br>Observations of Herbig-Haro objects provide a dramatically clear look at collapsing circumstellar disks
of dust and gas that build stars and provide the ingredients for planetary systems.</br>
<br>Jets of hot gas are funneled from deep within these embryonic systems, and bursts of material are ejected from the young stellar objects at
speeds of nearly a half-million kilometers per hour.</br>
<br>The Herbig-Haro object HH111 shows the fast-moving jet of material from a newborn star colliding with the interstellar medium. As the bipolar flow from a young star plows
into the surrounding gas, it generates strong shock waves that heat and ionize the gas.</br>
<br> In the cooling gas behind the shock front, electrons and ions recombine to give an emission line spectrum characteristic of Herbig-Haro
objects.</br>
<br>All known Herbig-Haro objects have been found within the boundaries of dark clouds, and are strong
sources of infrared radiation.</br>

      <br>The Trifid Nebula is one of the most prominent nebulas in the night sky. Radiation from the powerful central star is eating away at the surrounding dense interstellar material.</br>
    <br>The field of view of this Hubble image includes a region of star formation that will be destroyed by the advancing ionization front in the next ~20,000 years. 
  <br>A prominent jet from a young stellar object and a long finger with a possible young stellar object at its tip are apparent in the image. The stellar jet is emerging from the wall of a cloud in the Trifid Nebula.</br> 
<br>The jet is remarkable because, unlike most stellar jets, it can be seen along its entire length. This is because the jet is being lit up by radiation from the massive, luminous star that powers the Trifid.</br>
<br>The tip of a finger-like Evaporating Gaseous Globule, or "EGG", points back at the Trifid's central star. A tiny jet emerging from the EGG and a patch of reflected light suggest that a young stellar object is buried in the tip of the jet. This young stellar object was uncovered a few tens of thousands of years ago as radiation from the Trifid’s central star disrupted the dense cloud from which the star formed.</br>

    <br>A T Tauri star is a very young, lightweight star, less than 10 million years old and under 3 solar masses, that it still undergoing gravitational contraction; it represents an intermediate stage between a protostar and a mid-mass main sequence star like the Sun.</br>
  <br>T Tauri stars are found only in nebulas or very young clusters, have low- temperature (G to M type) spectra with strong emission lines and broad absorption lines.</br>
<br>They are more luminous than main sequence stars of similar spectral types, and they have a high lithium abundance, which is a pointer to their extreme youth, as lithium is rapidly destroyed in stellar interiors.</br>
<br>T Tauri stars often have large accretion disks left over from stellar formation. Their erratic brightness changes may be due to instabilities in the disk, violent activity in the stellar atmosphere, or nearby clouds of gas and dust that sometimes obscure the starlight.</br>
<br>Two broad T Tauri types are recognized based on spectroscopic characteristics that arise from their disk properties: classical T Tauri and weak-lined T Tauri stars.</br>
<br>Classical T Tauri stars have extensive disks that result in strong emission lines. Weak-lined T Tauri stars are surrounded by a disk that is very weak or no longer in existence.</br>
<br>The weak T Tauri stars are of particular interest since they provide astronomers with a look at early stages of stellar evolution unencumbered by nebulous material. Some of the absent disk matter may have gone into making planetesimals, from which planets might eventually form.</br>
<br>According to one estimate, about 60% of T Tauri stars younger than 3 million years may possess dust disks, compared with only 10% of stars that are 10 million years old. T Tauri stars represent an evolutionary stage between protostar and the main sequence for mid-mass sized stars and are located just above the main sequence on the H-R diagram.</br>
